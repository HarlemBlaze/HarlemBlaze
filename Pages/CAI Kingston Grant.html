            <li>First up we have Inosuke, he is a teenager who has been wearing a boar head since he was an infant.</li>
            <li>Zoro is a man who loves to drink and sleep. he has 3 swords and uses either separately or simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Then Last is a character made by people who were fans of dragon ball z, and his name is Drip Goku. He has no powers just forms.</li>

    <p>Each one of those characters are the protagonist for each game. 
        <li>we have Frank west, a man who went to a mall full of zombies, survivors and phychos to try and catch a scoop. Frank West is a photo journalist he has "covered wars you know." Which is his most used catchphrased in the series.</li> 
        <p></p>
        <li>Next up is Chuck Greene a EX-motorcross stunt man who needs to get an antigen/antidote for his daughter katy.</li>
       <p></p>
        <li>Then last on the list we have Nick Ramos. Nick Ramos is a man who has the experience of a mechanic and has a number on the side of his neck. He always puts people first before himself. Nick Ramos is a man who was an orphan and has a number on his neck and that number represnts the antidote in his body. So if he gets bite he can heal straight away.</li>
